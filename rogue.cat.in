[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mRogue[24m  is a computer fantasy game with a new twist.  It is crt oriented
       and the object of the game is to survive the attacks  of  various  mon-
       sters and get a lot of gold, rather than the puzzle solving orientation
       of most computer fantasy games.

       To  get started you really only need to know two commands.  The command
       [1m?  [22mwill give you a list of the available commands  and  the  command  [1m/[0m
       will identify the things you see on the screen.

       To  win  the  game (as opposed to merely playing to beat other people's
       high scores) you must locate the Amulet of Yendor  which  is  somewhere
       below  the  20th  level  of  the  dungeon  and  get it out.  Nobody has
       achieved this yet and if somebody does, they will probably go  down  in
       history as a hero among heroes.

       When  the game ends, either by your death, when you quit, or if you (by
       some miracle) manage to win, [4mrogue[24m will give you a list of the  top-ten
       scorers.   The  scoring  is  based entirely upon how much gold you get.
       There is a 10% penalty for getting yourself killed.

       If [4msave_file[24m is specified, rogue will be restored  from  the  specified
       saved  game file.  If the [1m-r [22moption is used, the save game file is pre-
       sumed to be the default.

       The [1m-s [22moption will print out the list of scores.

       The [1m-d [22moption will kill you and try to add you to the score file.

       The [1m-V [22mwill print the release and version (same as the rogue v command)
       and then exit.

[1mBUGS[0m
       Probably  infinite  (although  countably  infinite).  However, that Ice
       Monsters sometimes transfix you permanently is [4mnot[24m a bug.  It's a  fea-
       ture.
